classdef RangeFinder < Sensor
%RangeFinder 
%
% Given a set of angles and a maximum distance RangeFinder senses the
% vehicles around the agent returning for each angle the distance from the
% vehicles within the specified maximum range.
%
% RangeFinder:
%
% s = RangeFinder(angles);
% s = RangeFinder(angles,maxDistance);
%
% The size of the vehicles are determined by the proper occupancy of the
% class Vehicle. See help Vehicle.
